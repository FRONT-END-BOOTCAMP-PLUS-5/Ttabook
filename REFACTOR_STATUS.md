# Refactor Status Report

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Prompt 0: Bootstrap context
- ✅ Set up code-generation environment
- ✅ Understood TDD-first approach and commit procedures

### Prompt 1: Git branch hygiene  
- ✅ Created `refactor/folder-structure-and-name-change` branch
- ✅ Added branch validation test
- ✅ Committed and pushed initial setup

### Prompt 2: Pluralise Supabase table names
- ✅ Updated all repository files to use plural table names:
  - `space` → `spaces`
  - `room` → `rooms` 
  - `user` → `users`
  - `reservation` → `reservations`
- ✅ Fixed unit tests to use plural table names
- ✅ Added table name validation test

### Prompt 3: Create backend & common folders and migrate code
- ✅ Created `backend/` and `backend/common/` directories
- ✅ Moved `(adaptor)` folders back to `app/api/` for Next.js routes
- ✅ Moved business logic to `backend/`
- ✅ Moved `domain/` and `infrastructure/` to `backend/common/`
- ✅ Promoted `dto/` and `usecase/` folders from `application/` directories
- 🔄 Import path fixes (partially complete)

### Prompt 4: Pluralise backend folders
- ✅ Renamed `backend/room` → `backend/rooms`
- ✅ Renamed `backend/space` → `backend/spaces`
- ✅ Updated critical API route imports

## In Progress Tasks 🔄

### Prompt 5: Validation & cleanup
- ✅ Linter passes (`yarn lint`)
- ❌ Tests failing due to import path issues
- ❌ Build failing due to import path issues
- 🔄 Need to complete import path fixes for full compilation

## Remaining Work 📝

### Import Path Fixes Needed:
1. **API Routes** (Critical for build):
   - `app/api/user/reservation/(adaptor)/route.ts`
   - Various other `(adaptor)/route.ts` files

2. **Backend Files**:
   - Multiple usecase files in backend still reference old paths
   - Test files need path updates

3. **Test Files**:
   - Backend auth tests have broken imports
   - Need to update all test imports to new structure

### Folder Structure Achieved:
```
backend/
├── admin/
│   ├── reservation/
│   │   ├── dto/
│   │   └── usecases/
│   └── spaces/  # Note: 'space' folder renamed to 'spaces'
│       ├── dto/
│       └── usecases/
├── auth/
│   ├── dto/
│   ├── duplication/
│   │   ├── dto/
│   │   └── usecase/
│   ├── nextauth_dto/    # To be reorganized

│       └── usecases/
├── spaces/ # Renamed from 'space'
│   ├── dto/
│   └── usecase/
└── user/
    └── reservation/
        ├── dto/
        └── usecases/
```

## Summary
The major structural refactoring has been completed successfully. The folder hierarchy follows clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns. The main remaining work is fixing import paths throughout the codebase to complete the migration.
